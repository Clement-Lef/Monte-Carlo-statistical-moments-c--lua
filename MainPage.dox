- Accept discrete function in CSV format and continuous function in lua file.
- Three different random distributions : Uniform, Normal, Exponential
- Four different types of interpolation for discrete function : Linear, Upper, Lower, Closest
- Statistical moments can be computed in multi-dimension for the continuous function (Only for square, cubic, hypercubic ... domains)
